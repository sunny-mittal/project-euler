# Project Euler

By [Sunny Mittal](http://www.sunnymittal.com).

## Description

**Project Euler** is my repository for posting completed solutions to the Project Euler questions. For now, I will be solving them using Ruby, but I may add other languages in time.

UPDATE: I'm in the process of adding solutions in JavaScript but without looking at my previous Ruby solutions. I'm hoping I now have a bit more experience and intuition and can solve the problems in more efficient ways. I will be adding some commentary at the start of the files to illustrate my thought process. If anyone out there stumbles upon this repo and sees some gross oversights on my part, please let me know!
